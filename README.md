  * Nursing: A Concept-Based Approach to Learning provides all of the core content and materials needed to deliver an effective concept-based program that develops practice-ready nurses. This three-volume series is the only concepts curriculum developed from the ground up as a cohesive, comprehensive learning system. An intentional instructional design and learning pattern fosters connections between concepts and a deep level of comprehension that can be applied broadly. Volume II focuses on 30 crucial psychosocial, reproductive, nursing, and healthcare concepts, and then turns to the nurse’s broader roles in areas such as accountability, advocacy, and safety. The 3rd edition is a full-scale, cover-to-cover revision that brings the text in line with new evidence-based practice, care, and safety guidelines.
